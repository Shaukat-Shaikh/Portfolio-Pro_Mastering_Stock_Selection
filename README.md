# Portfolio-Pro_Mastering_Stock_Selection

## 📌 Overview
Portfolio Pro is a **Python-based stock selection model** that leverages **data science and financial insights** to analyze stocks and help users make informed decisions. This project processes data from **2,000+ NSE-listed companies**, applying **quantitative analysis and trend evaluation** to filter out the best investment opportunities.

📉 **Why?** Market downturns create the best buying opportunities—if you know how to identify them. Instead of relying on speculation, Portfolio Pro helps you make decisions based on **real data and historical trends**.

🚀 **Note:** This is an educational project demonstrating how data science can be applied to stock analysis. **It is NOT investment advice.**
